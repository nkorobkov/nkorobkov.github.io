### Rules

Memory Pinball is a small and relatively simple game.   

You are presented with a square grid with walls in some squares.

Your task is to memorize walls as well as you can within a few seconds. Because after a few seconds, the walls will fade, and the ball would show up.

And now your task is to predict where the ball will leave the field if you push it on the field. The ball will move linearly and bounce off the walls.

You goal is to predict correctly. And that's it!
