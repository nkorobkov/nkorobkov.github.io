I wanted a way to keep track of plant watering schedule. 

I wanted a tool to remind me to water plants once a week, that would have one button. And when the button is pressed, new one week countdown would start. Regardless of whethere the task was completted ahead of schedule or with delay. It should always restart the timer with predefined number of days.

I wanted a physical device. None of those iphone apps or google calendar extentions. I wanted the button to be right next to the plant I just wattered.

I wanted this for four tasks: wattering plants, changing water filter, changing bedsheets and changing toothbrush. 

So I decided to order a bunch of electircal components, Arduino Nano board, e-inc screen and build a physical low-energy device. 

Here is what I got:

I failed in a lot of places, especially in a low energy part. So to make it work for 6 months I had to replace 2 CR2032 bataries with 4 C. 

So it started looking ugly. But it worked quite fine!

My dad helped a lot with plate design and 3D printing.
