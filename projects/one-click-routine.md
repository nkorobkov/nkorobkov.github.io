I wanted a way to track when I need to water my plants. 
I tried building a [hardware device](https://nkorobkov.com/projects/routine-tracker) for this, but it turned out to be more challenging than expected. After the first iteration I had to reorder different components and rewire it for a better prototype, which didn't feel particularly exciting. So I built a web app. 

It works great.

See it here: <https://nkorobkov.com/one-click-routine/>

I run it on my second phone as an always-on display in my kitchen.

To make the webpage behave like an app, I use Safari's "Add to Homescreen" function. To keep it always on, I enable "Guided Access" in the iPhone settings menu.
