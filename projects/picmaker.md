PicMaker is a project  I did in summer camp in 2013. I was in 11 grade of high school at that time. 

It is a Visual Basic application that uses idea of cellular automata to generate ornaments of pixels of dfferent colors. 

The pictures look something like this:

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/picmaker/circle.bmp" alt="circle" border="1" style="max-height: 450px" />

### Interface

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/picmaker/screen-2.png" alt="circle" border="1" style="max-height: 600px" />


Little form around the image area helps control:
 
- Field size;
- Type of field generation (random or empty);
- Appearance of grid and center marker;
- Iteration speed;
- Different cell types color;
- Different cell types activeness and visibility;

### Generated images examples

{% include slideshow.html %}

That was the first time I realized I really love programming.
